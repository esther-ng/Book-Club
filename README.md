# Book-Club

Based on feedback from our previous tech book club book, this is the format we will be using for our next book, [Understanding Computation](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Computation-Machines-Impossible-Programs/dp/1449329276/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1468269483&sr=8-1&keywords=understanding+computation).
